<h1>Chapter 20 — Threads Between Worlds</h1>

<p>The hum of the Solace machine pulsed like a heartbeat—steady, insistent. Nora’s chest rose and fell with shallow gasps. Around her, the hospital walls blurred and stretched, the sterile white folding into ribbons of gold and shadow.</p>

<p>She felt herself tipping, falling—not down, not up, but through. Pain flooded her head, washing memories of Australia 2018, the car crash, and the battlefields of the Weave together into a single, swirling storm.</p>

<p>Her hand shot out instinctively, and light answered. Threads shimmered beneath her fingers, writhing and coiling, reaching toward the pulse of the Solace machine as if the device itself had become the loom.</p>

<p><em>“Nora…”</em></p>

<p>Solas’ voice—or the echo of it—thrummed in her mind: tangible, insistent. <em>“You are here and there. The fracture is strong. Hold the Weave. Hold yourself.”</em></p>

<p>The battlefield tugged at her; the Unmakers writhed on the edges of perception, layered over hospital walls, IV tubes, and sterile monitors. Every thread she touched shimmered, connecting the two worlds and making her a bridge between dream and reality.</p>

<p>A scream echoed in her skull—half her own, half the Weave—but she clung to the pulse of the threads, guided by Solas’ presence. Light flared along the paths, coiling around shadowy tendrils and refracting across fractured memories of her life.</p>

<p>For a moment, she could see both: the hospital room and the battlefield superimposed over it. Nurses moved like ghosts among the Unmakers, monitors beeped in time with sword strikes, and the Solace machine’s glow pulsed in tandem with cosmic energy.</p>

<p>Nora’s breath caught. <em>“I… I can do this,”</em> she whispered. The threads hummed in agreement. The fracture-point, the patient, the dreamer, the warrior—all her selves converged.</p>

<p><em>“Good,”</em> Solas whispered, closer now. <em>“We are stronger together. The Weave bends because you do not reject it. But remember—the closer you walk to the edge, the more fragile the boundary between worlds becomes.”</em></p>

<p>Her vision stretched, folding space and time. Even if the fever dream—or coma—was real, it no longer mattered. The threads themselves were alive, and she was their anchor.</p>

<p>The Unmakers surged. The hospital walls twisted. The sword pulsed. And at the center of it all, Nora stepped forward, straddling two realities, ready to fight—and ready to see what the Weave demanded of her next.</p>
