<h1>Pulse of Connection</h1>
<h2>Chapter 8 — The Veil of Immensity</h2>

<p>The noise of war dissolved, muffled behind an ocean of glass. Nora’s knees buckled, but she did not fall; an unseen current carried her upward, away, until the battlefield shrank to a speck beneath her.</p>

<p>The sky tore itself open—not with fire, nor storm, but with silence vast enough to swallow thought. She drifted into it, suspended in darkness so immense it shimmered like velvet threaded with hidden stars.</p>

<p>And then—she saw. Not with her eyes, but with something deeper.</p>

<p>The world below was not alone. Countless others orbited it like lanterns adrift in an infinite sea, each bound by lines of light too complex to follow, stitched into a tapestry beyond comprehension. Some glowed brilliantly; others flickered weakly, on the verge of extinction.</p>

<p>Beyond them, larger forms moved. Shapes that bent the fabric of space, shifting too quickly for her mind to hold. They were not men, not machines, not anything she had language for. Yet they were aware. Watching. Waiting.</p>

<p>One paused. Its attention turned toward her.</p>

<p>Nora felt it—like the press of an ocean on a single grain of sand. Its gaze stripped away body, thought, and will until she was bare, vibrating on the edge of dissolution. She wanted to scream, but no sound came.</p>

<p>Then a whisper threaded through the void, vast yet intimate, as if spoken inside her bones:<br>
<em>“You are the fracture-point. Through you, the weave will hold… or unravel.”</em></p>

<p>Her vision shifted again. Threads—millions of them—stretched from her body into the darkness. Some gleamed with light; others pulsed black with rot. Each tugged at her, pulling in opposite directions, demanding choice. But which?</p>

<p>The immensity shuddered, a ripple running through the tapestry, and the vast beings turned away—as though something even greater had drawn their attention elsewhere. The vision collapsed like ash in the wind.</p>

<p>Nora gasped awake on the battlefield, sweat cold on her skin. The clash of blades returned, faint and distant, meaningless compared to the immensity she had touched.</p>

<p>Her sword felt heavier now. Not with steel, but with destiny.</p>
