<h1>Pulse of Connection</h1>
<h2>Chapter 30 — Awakening Threads</h2>

<p>Nora stood at the edge of the forest behind her childhood home, now twelve, sun low in the sky. <span class="special">Solas the kitten</span>—no longer a tiny kitten but agile and alert—padded at her feet. The world seemed ordinary enough, yet the threads whispered faintly beneath her skin, tugging at her awareness.</p>

<p>She closed her eyes and reached out, just a flicker of intent, and felt it: the threads responded. Light rippled along the edges of the trees, bending shadows as if listening. Subtle, a whisper rather than a roar, yet enough.</p>

<p><span class="inner-thought">“Focus,”</span> <span class="special">Solas the kitten</span>’s presence murmured in her mind, steady and warm. <span class="inner-thought">“They are near. The Unmakers sense you. Shape the threads, or they will shape you.”</span></p>

<p>Nora’s pulse quickened. She lifted her hand, instinct guiding her. A flicker of light arced across the forest floor, and the shadows that had begun to gather twisted away, uneasy.</p>

<p>She remembered fragments of herself—so many lives, so many selves—folding together:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The toddler, hugging <span class="special">Solas the kitten</span>, learning instinctively to defend herself.</li>
  <li>The child in 1957, resisting mental erasure, gripping her identity even when powerless.</li>
  <li>The older, dementia-afflicted self, navigating fear and chaos with instinct.</li>
  <li>The cosmic-warrior self, battling the Unmakers with sword and threads.</li>
  <li>Coma-Nora, tethered to the pulse of the Solace machine, stabilizing the fracture.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was overwhelming, yet exhilarating. For the first time, adolescent Nora could feel all these selves as part of her, not as strangers but as extensions of herself. The threads pulsed in response, vibrant, alive, and obedient.</p>

<p>A shadow flickered at the edge of her vision, a lingering probe from the Unmakers, testing her skill, seeking weakness.</p>

<p>Nora exhaled. <span class="special">Solas the kitten</span> nuzzled her hand, warmth and presence grounding her. She extended her fingers deliberately. Threads of light arced from her hand, forming a lattice across the shadow. It recoiled, twisting and shrinking, caught in the pulse of her awareness.</p>

<p>A thrill of realization coursed through her. <span class="inner-thought">I can do this. I can shape it.</span></p>

<p>The shadows hissed, gathering again—but now, she did not flinch. She was learning, practicing, weaving herself across realities. Each flicker of light, each twist of the threads, became a rehearsal, a training ground for the battles yet to come.</p>

<p>And somewhere in the lattice of her mind, <span class="special">Solas the kitten</span> whispered: <span class="inner-thought">“Good. You are ready to learn the ways of the Weave. But the Unmakers will test you… and the weave will demand more than instinct alone. Be prepared.”</span></p>

<p>Nora smiled faintly, tightening her grip on <span class="special">Solas the kitten</span>. The threads hummed in response, and for the first time, she felt power and control, tempered with the knowledge that the realities were not yet fully hers—but that they could be.</p>
