<h1>Pulse of Connection</h1>
<h2>Chapter Six: The Fortress Above</h2>

<p>The sky split open.</p>

<p>The fortress-ship descended with the weight of judgment, its underbelly bristling with spires and cannons like the teeth of a predator. Its shadow devoured the battlefield, smothering firelight and morning sun alike.</p>

<p>Nora felt the air tighten, every breath thick as iron. The bond pulsed with raw fear. She steadied herself, forcing strength into the thread that bound them all.</p>

<p>“Hold,” she whispered, though her hands trembled. “Hold the line.”</p>

<p>The ship’s cannons began to glow—lines of molten energy running along its frame. Survivors ducked instinctively. Then a voice thundered, echoing in their minds.</p>

<p>It was not human. Not alive.</p>

<p>“SUBMIT.”</p>

<p>The word carved itself into their minds, vibrating through bone and blood, leaving an ache behind the eyes. Several survivors dropped weapons, clutching their skulls, screaming.</p>

<p>Nora clenched her jaw. “Fight it,” she growled. She pressed the bond outward. <em>You are not theirs. You are human. We are humanity.</em></p>

<p>The fortress seemed to listen.</p>

<p>Its cannons whined, charging. The ground beneath Nora thrummed, cracks spidering outward.</p>

<p>A shockwave tore the street apart, hurling bodies and machines into the air. Survivors screamed as rubble collapsed around them.</p>

<p>Nora slammed into the ground, pain roaring through her back. Through haze, she saw the circle broken—survivors scattered, crawling, bleeding, dazed.</p>

<p>The bond flickered. Threads of connection frayed under despair.</p>

<p>“NO!” Nora roared, voice shredding her throat. She gripped her spear high. <em>I will not let you fall.</em></p>

<p>The bond surged—wild, furious, unchained. It wrapped the survivors like fire, dragging them back from despair.</p>

<p>One by one, they rose. Bloodied, broken—but alive.</p>

<p>The machines advanced. Survivors charged without waiting. Screams of defiance filled the smoke. Blades flashed, torches burned, steel clashed against metal hide. The Harvesters faltered—not from strength, but from sheer willpower.</p>

<p>Above, the fortress shifted—curious, probing, searching. Not for weakness, but for her.</p>

<p>The bond had drawn its attention.</p>

<p>For the first time, the fortress spoke to one, not all.</p>

<p>“YOU.”</p>

<p>The word echoed inside her skull, sharp, insistent, hungrier than anything she had felt.</p>

<p>The central cannon began to open—a weapon of annihilation. Nora’s pulse thundered, but she stood rooted, staring into the abyss of its core. The voice whispered again:</p>

<p>“YOU ARE ANOMALY.”</p>

<p>It peeled through her mind, tasting memories, grief, fire. The fortress was aware.</p>

<p>Nora slammed her fist against her chest. No. Not yours. Not ever.</p>

<p>She pushed the bond outward, fury spilling into the survivors. Some fell to knees, others screamed with her. Voices ragged, unyielding.</p>

<p>The machine hesitated. That was her opening.</p>

<p>“NOW!” she roared.</p>

<p>Torches arced through the air, flames clinging to oil-soaked rubble. Sparks struck the fortress’s underside. Not enough to harm—but defiance incarnate.</p>

<p>Harvesters rushed to restore order, mechanical limbs slashing. Survivors filled gaps, lent strength, fought as one. The bond glowed inside them.</p>

<p>Then—a streak of blue fire cut the sky. Rising, not descending. From the earth, from a broken power station buried in the ruins, a figure emerged. Metal gleaming, alien light flowing over every joint. Not soulless. Not cold. Living.</p>

<p>The fortress reacted, voice sharp, furious, almost afraid. “TRAITOR.”</p>

<p>The being met Nora’s gaze. For an instant, she felt it through the bond—not human, not like the fortress. Something in-between.</p>

<p>It raised a hand, blue fire crackling in its palm. “Fight with me.”</p>

<p>The fortress roared, mountains splitting. Its cannon surged, preparing to end everything.</p>

<p>Nora lifted her spear, blood singing with the bond, fire, and the arrival of this impossible ally.</p>

<p>The sky became a battlefield of gods.</p>
