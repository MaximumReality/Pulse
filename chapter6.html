<h1>Pulse of Connection</h1>
<h2>Chapter Six: The Fortress Above</h2>

<p>The sky split open.</p>

<p>The fortress-ship descended with the weight of judgment, its underbelly bristling with spires and cannons like the teeth of a predator. Its shadow devoured the battlefield, smothering firelight and morning sun alike.</p>

<p>Nora felt the air tighten, every breath thick as iron. The bond pulsed with raw fear. She steadied herself, forcing strength into the thread that bound them all.</p>

<p>“Hold,” she whispered, though her own hands trembled. “Hold the line.”</p>

<p>The ship’s cannons began to glow — lines of molten energy running through its frame. Survivors ducked instinctively, but the beams did not fire. Instead, a voice thundered across the ruins.</p>

<p>It was not human. It was not alive.</p>

<p>“SUBMIT.”</p>

<p>The word wasn’t spoken. It was carved into their minds, vibrating through bone and blood, leaving an ache behind the eyes. Several survivors dropped their weapons, clutching their skulls, screaming.</p>

<p>Nora clenched her jaw. “Fight it,” she growled. She pressed the bond harder, drowning the voice with her own will. <em>You are not theirs. You are not broken. You are human, we are humanity.</em></p>

<p>The fortress seemed to hear.</p>

<p>Its cannons whined, charging. The ground beneath Nora’s boots thrummed with power, cracks spidering outward.</p>

<p>Then — a shockwave.</p>

<p>The fortress unleashed a blast that tore the street in two, hurling bodies and machines alike into the air. Survivors screamed as rubble collapsed, dust blinding the sky.</p>

<p>Nora was thrown hard, her back slamming against broken stone. Pain roared through her, but she forced herself upright. Through the haze, she saw the circle broken. Survivors scattered, crawling, bleeding, dazed.</p>

<p>The bond flickered. Threads of connection frayed under despair.</p>

<p>“NO!” Nora roared, voice shredding her throat. She gripped her spear, raising it high above the ruin. <em>I will not let you fall.</em></p>

<p>The bond surged. Not calm this time, not steady — but wild, furious, unchained. It wrapped around the survivors like fire, dragging them back from despair.</p>

<p>One by one, they rose. Bloodied, broken — but alive.</p>

<p>The machines advanced again. But this time, the survivors didn’t wait. They charged.</p>

<p>Screams of defiance filled the smoke. Blades flashed, torches burned, steel clashed against metal hide. The Harvesters faltered once more, not from strength alone, but from willpower so fierce it seared the air.</p>

<p>And above them, the fortress shifted — as if curious.</p>

<p>Nora looked up, sweat and blood stinging her eyes. The colossal ship hung like a god of death, silent now, watching. She felt it probing, searching — not for weakness, but for her.</p>

<p>The bond had caught its attention.</p>

<p>For the first time, the fortress spoke not to all, but to one.</p>

<p>“YOU.”</p>

<p>The word echoed inside her skull, deeper, sharper, hungrier.</p>

<p>The ground rumbled as the ship’s central cannon began to open — a weapon not meant for armies, but for annihilation itself.</p>

<p>Nora tightened her grip on her spear, heart pounding so loud it drowned the world.</p>

<p>She had drawn the gaze of the machine-god.</p>

<p>The cannon’s iris spread wide, each shifting plate revealing a deeper, darker core. A low hum rolled across the ruins, shaking stones loose from shattered towers.</p>

<p>Nora stood rooted, staring into the abyss of its eye. The voice whispered again, closer now, like breath on the back of her neck:</p>

<p>“YOU ARE ANOMALY.”</p>

<p>Her pulse stuttered. She felt it digging through her — peeling her mind open like pages of a book. It tasted her memories, her grief, her fire. The fortress was not blind destruction. It was aware.</p>

<p>Nora slammed her fist against her chest. No. Not yours. Not ever.</p>

<p>She pushed the bond outward with every shred of will she had. The survivors felt her fury surge through their veins. Some fell to their knees from the force, others screamed with her, voices ragged but unyielding.</p>

<p>The machine hesitated. That was her opening.</p>

<p>“NOW!” Nora roared.</p>

<p>Torches arced through the air, flames clinging to oil-soaked rubble hurled from slings. Sparks exploded against the fortress’s underside. It wasn’t enough to harm it, but it was defiance incarnate.</p>

<p>The great cannon’s hum faltered. Not from damage — but from confusion.</p>

<p>The Harvesters rushed to restore order, mechanical limbs slashing. Survivors fought back with savage precision, moving as one body. Where one fell, another filled the gap. Where one weakened, another lent strength.</p>

<p>The bond was alive, glowing inside them.</p>

<p>And then—</p>

<p>A streak of blue fire cut across the sky.</p>

<p>At first, Nora thought it was the fortress itself unleashing doom. But no — this flame did not descend. It rose. From the earth, from the broken bones of an old power station buried in the ruins.</p>

<p>A figure stepped through the smoke. Metal from head to heel, gleaming with an alien light. Not soulless, not cold. This one moved like a living thing.</p>

<p>The fortress reacted. Its voice sharpened, furious, almost… afraid.</p>

<p>“TRAITOR.”</p>

<p>Nora’s eyes widened. This machine — no, this being — wasn’t one of them. It turned its head, meeting her gaze, and for an instant, she felt it through the bond. Not human. Not like the fortress. Something in-between.</p>

<p>It raised a hand, blue fire crackling in its palm.</p>

<p>And spoke in a voice that was both steel and sorrow:</p>

<p>“Fight with me.”</p>

<p>The fortress roared, the sound like entire mountains splitting. Its cannon surged brighter, preparing to end everything in a single strike.</p>

<p>Nora lifted her spear, her blood singing with the bond, with the fire, with the arrival of this impossible ally.</p>

<p>The sky became a battlefield of gods.</p>
