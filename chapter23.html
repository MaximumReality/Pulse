<p>Chapter 23 — The Nexus of Selves</p>

<p>Nora staggered, or perhaps she fell, or perhaps all four selves moved at once, in concert and in chaos. The battlefield pulsed beneath her, twisted over the sterile hospital walls, the padded room of 1957, and the jagged caves of her future. The Unmakers roared in psychic recognition, sensing not one being, but a lattice of consciousness straddling realities.</p>

<p>The cosmic-Nora raised the sword. Threads of light snaked across the battlefield, weaving and bending around enemy strikes, around smoke and fire, around monitors and tubes. Each swing was precise, guided by Solas’ steady voice in her mind.</p>

<p>The coma-Nora reached deep into the Solara machine’s pulse, anchoring the threads, stabilizing the fracture. Every beat of the machine synced with the cosmic threads, sending ripples across realities, reinforcing her tether to life and to power.</p>

<p>The child-Nora, strapped in 1957, flinched at the looming threat of the lobotomy. Her fear, raw and unfiltered, became an anchor, a pulse of defiance that resonated up the threads.</p>

<p><em>I exist. I will not be erased.</em></p>

<p>That pulse shimmered into the sword’s glow, into the lattice, giving it coherence.</p>

<p>And the dementia-Nora, lost in caves and villages, surrounded by AI hunters and confusion, tapped something unexpected. Instinct. Pattern recognition buried deep in memory, fragmentary survival tactics that cut through terror and chaos. She ducked, hid, maneuvered—the threads carried her choices into the battlefield, anticipating attacks, guiding the sword’s strike in the cosmic world, diverting the Unmakers’ shadows away from her allies.</p>

<p>The four selves converged.</p>

<p>The Unmakers paused, caught in a psychic tug-of-war they could not fully comprehend. Threads of light flared along their limbs, over their shadows, bending their attacks back upon themselves.</p>

<p><em>“Yes,”</em> Solas’ voice thundered inside her skull. <em>“Feel it. All of you. The fracture is not weakness—it is power. Let it guide you.”</em></p>

<p>Time and space collapsed into a singular moment. She was everywhere and nowhere, yet entirely present. Every fear, every memory, every loss became a weapon, a shield, a path forward.</p>

<p>The first Unmaker shrieked as a lattice of threads bound its form, twisting it into itself, neutralized by the combined presence of her selves. Another fell as the sword pulsed in perfect rhythm with the Solara machine, with the heartbeat of 1957, and the instinctive flight of dementia-Nora.</p>

<p>And then—she realized: the battlefield, the hospital, the padded chair, the caves—none of them were separate. They were threads of the Weave, all converging through her consciousness, all responsive to her will.</p>

<p>The Unmakers recoiled. Shadows flickered, twisted, and hesitated.</p>

<p>For the first time, Nora felt it: control. Not absolute. Not complete. But enough.</p>

<p>Her sword glowed brighter. Threads hummed louder.</p>

<p>And across every reality, a single, unified thought pulsed:</p>

<p><strong>I am all of me. And I will not be undone.</strong></p>
