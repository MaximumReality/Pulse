<p>Chapter 12 — The Coming of the Unmakers</p>

<p>The threads quivered, snapping like brittle glass as the darkness pressed closer. At first it was only a tide—black oil bleeding through light. Then, from the tide, shapes emerged.</p>

<p>They were not consistent. Each blink reshaped them: a maw of teeth, a shroud of wings, a storm of knives, a hollow shell. Yet beneath every form, Nora sensed the same truth: hunger without end.</p>

<p>The Unmakers.</p>

<p>The faceless being faltered, its galaxy-flesh dimming under their approach. “You were not meant to face them here.”</p>

<p>But the Unmakers had already noticed her. A dozen shifting heads snapped in unison, a dozen eyeless gazes fastening on her light. The sword blazed brighter, betraying her.</p>

<p>They moved. Not walking, not flying, but consuming distance itself. Wherever they passed, threads withered and stars drowned in silence.</p>

<p>The whispers of the stars turned to cries. Nora… Nora… hold fast…</p>

<p>One of the Unmakers lunged. Its form splintered into tendrils of shadow, each one a serrated edge of nothingness. Nora raised her sword instinctively, and the weapon met the tendrils with a clash that produced no sound—only a vibration that rattled her bones. Sparks of light flared as threads reknit themselves around her.</p>

<p>Another surged from her left, its body a roiling storm of faceless masks. Each mask screamed in a language that made her teeth ache. Nora swung her sword again, the blade cutting arcs of pure radiance. The screams faltered, torn apart mid-echo.</p>

<p>Still, the tide pressed closer. Ten, twenty, a hundred shapes converged, and she knew she could not hold them all.</p>

<p>The faceless being reached toward her, voice strained: “You must decide—will you wield the current to bind, or to sever? To weave, or to cut away?”</p>

<p>The sword hummed violently in her grip, threads pulling toward it like rivers drawn to the sea. The choice throbbed inside her chest, impossible, inescapable.</p>

<p>The Unmakers shrieked, advancing as one. The sea of stars dimmed. The loom itself trembled.</p>

<p>Nora stood at the center, one heartbeat from annihilation, one breath from rewriting everything.</p>
