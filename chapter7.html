<h1>Pulse of Connection</h1>
<h2>Chapter Seven — The Shatter Between Worlds</h2>

<p>The clash of steel and the roar of war thundered in Nora’s ears. Then, suddenly, the world fractured like glass struck from within. Sound vanished. Movement blurred.</p>

<p>She stood alone on a barren plain beneath a sky split in two. One half burned with hungry red light. The other drowned in pale, endless void.</p>

<p>Her breath misted in the silence, though the air was neither cold nor warm. In the distance, faceless armies gathered, weapons raised—not in rage, but in silent waiting, as if for a signal never given.</p>

<p>A voice, deep as stone cracking, threaded itself through her skull:</p>
<p><em>“The war you see is not the war you fight. The true battle moves beneath the surface. Seek the root, or all branches will wither.”</em></p>

<p>Nora’s eyes dropped to the ground. The plain beneath her feet was no longer stone, but a vast web of roots, pulsing faintly with light. Some glowed healthy. Others blackened, shriveled, bleeding ash instead of sap.</p>

<p>She touched one. Fire surged up her arm. Visions flashed so quickly she could barely comprehend them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A ruined glass tower, smoke coiling skyward.</li>
  <li>A figure cloaked in obsidian, face shifting like a broken mirror.</li>
  <li>A boiling sea revealing a city rising from its depths.</li>
  <li>Her own eyes staring back, older, colder, a shadow crawling down her cheek.</li>
</ul>

<p>She gasped, staggering. The sky fractured further, white cracks splitting the red and void. Whispers poured from the fissures—not words, but syllables older than language itself, twisting inside her, filling her lungs.</p>

<p>Then silence.</p>

<p>A hand—warm, human—touched her shoulder. She turned. No one was there.</p>

<p>The vision shattered. The battlefield returned with brutal force: clashing blades, dying cries, choking smoke. Yet Nora stumbled, as if fallen from a great height. The roots, tower, and mirror-faced figure lingered in her mind.</p>

<p>She understood now: the war with flesh and steel was only a reflection. Something deeper waited beneath. Watching. Waiting.</p>
