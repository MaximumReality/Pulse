<h1>Chapter 28 — Flickers in the Mind</h1>

<p>The afternoon sun had softened to gold, streaking across the walls of Nora’s room. <span class="special">Solara the kitten</span> twitched in her lap, ears alert. Nora’s small hands rested on the rug, but her mind—too vast for her body—fluttered at the edges of something she could not name.</p>

<p>A shadow flickered across the corner of the room again, sharper this time. It pulsed with intent, a fragment of the Unmakers reaching across decades to probe her consciousness. Her stomach twisted; fear surged.</p>

<p><span class="inner-thought">“Little one… feel the threads,” whispered Solas, faint, a pulse rather than words. “Do not panic. Anchor yourself. Reach.”</span></p>

<p>Nora didn’t understand, not fully, but something inside her—a memory she couldn’t place, a fragment of battles and threads—guided her hands. She touched Solara, who purred steadily, warmth radiating like a pulse in the dark. The threads rippled through her fingertips, brushing against the shadow.</p>

<p>The shadow recoiled, then surged again. Nora’s eyes widened, but instinct took over. She swayed slightly, small motions of a toddler becoming movements in the threads, bending light and shadow subtly, diverting the darkness from Solara.</p>

<p>In a sudden flash, she glimpsed fragments of her older selves:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cosmic-Nora, swinging the sword across a battlefield, threads guiding each strike.</li>
  <li>Coma-Nora, stabilizing the pulse of the Solara machine in Australia 2018.</li>
  <li>Child-Nora in 1957, resisting straps and mental erasure.</li>
  <li>Dementia-Nora, ducking through caves, evading machine hunters.</li>
</ul>

<p>The visions flickered and disappeared, leaving only instinct. But they had left a residue—a faint confidence, a sense that she was not powerless.</p>

<p>The shadow lunged again, closer, probing. Nora pressed Solara to her chest and extended a small hand. The threads responded. A tiny pulse of light arced across the floor, touching the edges of the shadow. It hissed, recoiled, and thinned, like smoke in a breeze.</p>

<p>Her father peeked in, still carrying groceries. “Nora… you okay, honey?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” she said, smiling, though her heart still raced. She didn’t tell him about the shadows, the threads, or the battles in her mind. She couldn’t. But she felt the threads coil around her small body, comforting, protective, alive.</p>

<p>That night, curled in bed with <span class="special">Solara</span> purring on her chest, she felt the threads again, faint but insistent. The shadows were not gone—they were watching, waiting—but she had learned something: even at four, she could shape the unseen, defend herself across realities, and anchor herself through what mattered most.</p>

<p>And somewhere in the background of her mind, the lattice of her future selves hummed, waiting for the day she would wield them all consciously.</p>
