<h1>Chapter 32 — Weaving the Fractured</h1>

<p>The forest behind her childhood home shimmered in twilight. Adolescent Nora crouched in the underbrush, Solara pressed to her side, purring softly, a heartbeat anchor amid chaos. Her breath rose in rapid, shallow waves. Around her, threads of light hummed, bending and coiling like living rivers through the forest floor.</p>

<p>The lattice was vast, more immense than she could ever fully comprehend. The blackened strand of 1957 pulsed faintly, a hollow absence curling through her consciousness. She could feel it tugging at the edges of her power—a constant reminder of what could be lost if she faltered.</p>

<p>But she could not falter.</p>

<p>The Iraqi girl of 1979 appeared beside her in a ripple of heat and dust, the roar of tanks and gunfire echoing faintly through the threads. Nora reached out, instinctive, almost tender, guiding her across the invisible lattice. The girl ducked behind a crumbling wall, her wide, terrified eyes catching the sun, and Nora whispered through the threads, <span class="inner-thought">“Move. Trust the weave. Trust yourself.”</span></p>

<p>The adolescent Nora flexed her hands. The threads responded, vibrant and eager. She could feel the echoes of the toddler hugging Solara, the cosmic-Nora swinging a sword across impossibly vast battlefields, the dementia-afflicted self scrambling instinctively through caves. All of them pulsed within her, layered in a rhythm of light and energy, waiting for her command.</p>

<p><span class="inner-thought">“Focus,”</span> she murmured, voice low, almost a chant, almost a command. She could feel Solara’s warmth, the kitten’s pulse amplifying the threads, a living anchor across decades. Her fingers traced arcs in the air, twisting shadows and bending light. A flicker—a shadow—pushed at the edge of her awareness. The Unmakers were watching, probing, testing her limits.</p>

<p>She inhaled, the lattice vibrating with anticipation. Her awareness expanded. She felt the blackened strand quiver, faint but responsive, like a wound that had begun to heal. She reached into it, not to repair, not to erase, but to integrate. Slowly, carefully, she folded the hollow pulse of 1957 into the lattice, letting it spiral alongside the Iraqi girl’s vibrant thread, alongside her adolescent and cosmic selves. Pain met courage, absence met presence, fear met instinct—and together they hummed, unified, alive.</p>

<p>A shadow lunged. Dark, twisted, coiling toward her. She reacted instinctively. Threads of light arced from her fingertips, sweeping across the forest clearing, spiraling through multiple realities at once. The shadow shrieked, recoiled, and twisted, unable to pierce the coherence of her growing nexus.</p>

<p>The Iraqi girl mirrored her movements unknowingly, ducking, weaving, gripping her brother’s hand, instinct guided by the pulse of Nora’s lattice. Adolescent Nora’s lungs burned, pulse quickened, but the threads responded without hesitation, moving with her intent, weaving strategy and defense across space, time, and consciousness.</p>

<p><span class="inner-thought">Solas’ presence surged, warm and insistent.</span> <span class="inner-thought">“Good. Feel all of you. Control the weave. Let the blackened strands serve, let the fearful threads anchor. Every life is part of your power. Every shadow, every thread, responds to intent. Shape them.”</span></p>

<p>Nora closed her eyes. She felt the lattice coil and pulse around her, the blackened strand of 1957 spiraling in tandem with the Iraqi girl’s fear, the adolescent self’s determination, the cosmic self’s strength, and even the echoes of the toddler hugging Solara. Together, they formed a living, breathing web—a defense and a weapon.</p>

<p>The shadows recoiled again, twisting and coiling in hesitation. The Unmakers tested, probed, pushed—but Nora’s lattice shimmered with precision, alive with awareness. Every strike, every movement, every thought threaded across realities, anticipating, defending, shaping.</p>

<p>She exhaled slowly, feeling the pulse of Solara beneath her hand. The lattice hummed in acknowledgment. She was still learning. Still growing. But for the first time, she understood: the weave was hers to command, her selves both weapon and shield, and even broken strands could serve the whole.</p>

<p>A faint pulse ran across the threads—the echoes of battles yet to come, whispers of Unmakers that had felt her power, tasted her resolve. They were coming. They always came. But she was ready.</p>

<p>Nora smiled, small but determined, feeling the lattice hum and twist around her, alive, vibrant, united across all fragments of herself, and anchored by Solara’s steady warmth.</p>

<p>And the forest, the war-torn alleys of Iraq, the cosmic battlefield, and the hollow echo of 1957 all shimmered together in a single, perfect, dangerous harmony.</p>
