<h1>Pulse of Connection</h1>
<h2>Chapter 5 — Before the Storm</h2>

<p>The night was alive with tension. Every survivor felt it — the low tremor beneath their feet, the rhythm of countless boots and metal claws striking the earth in unison. The soulless army was moving.</p>

<p>The circle broke into motion. Some gathered weapons from ruined Harvesters, hacking armored plates into shields and blades. Others filled sacks with the little food that remained. A few searched the ruins for wires, glass, tubing—anything to become traps or signals.</p>

<p>Nora walked among them, her broken spear strapped to her back. People turned to her now, not with doubt, but expectation. It made her chest ache. She was not a leader, not a warrior. She was a woman who had survived—and yet, the bond whispered instructions in her ear.</p>

<p>“Before dawn,” she said, her voice carrying through the ruin. “We have hours — not days. We use them.”</p>

<p>A murmur of agreement rippled through the group.</p>

<p>She divided them quickly: fighters, builders, scouts, healers. The boy she had saved was moved into the healer’s care, pale but managing a weak grin. She squeezed his hand, feeling the bond pulse faintly between them.</p>

<p>At the edge of the ruin, two scouts returned breathless, terror etched on their faces.</p>

<p>“They’re not marching blind,” one gasped. “Drones. Hundreds of them. Flying ahead. Searching.”</p>

<p>Nora’s stomach tightened. Drones meant speed. They would find them before dawn.</p>

<p>The voice inside her mind returned, calm amid the storm. <em>You cannot outfight their numbers, Nora. But you can outthink them. Build. Prepare. And when they strike, let the bond carry you all.</em></p>

<p>She inhaled sharply. “We lay traps in the streets. Nets, spikes, fires to blind sensors. We fight not with strength, but with unity. Every move as one.”</p>

<p>The survivors nodded. Fear still weighed heavy, but something new was there too: resolve.</p>

<p>Through the night, they worked. Fires lined streets; smoke obscured vision. Spikes hammered into walls and ground; ropes stretched across alleys; debris funneled enemies into choke points. Children and elders were hidden in underground hollows, guarded by the wounded who could no longer fight.</p>

<p>Nora climbed the tallest ruin she could find, watching the horizon. The sound was louder now. Endless. The glow of red eyes spread like embers across the dark.</p>

<p>She gripped the edge of the shattered wall, heart pounding with the rhythm of the circle below. Dawn would bring blood—but also fire. The enemy would not take them easily.</p>

<p>The first drone came before the horizon lightened.</p>

<p>Its wings cut through the night with a high-pitched whine, red sensors flickering across the ruins. The survivors froze. Every heartbeat thudded in the silence.</p>

<p>Then Nora whispered, “Now.”</p>

<p>A rope snapped taut, pulling a weighted net across the alley. The drone struck, wings tangled in steel and stone, shrieking before being dragged down by waiting hands. Sparks lit the dark like fireflies.</p>

<p>Cheers rang out. Too soon.</p>

<p>The sky filled with more. Dozens. Hundreds.</p>

<p>They swarmed, red eyes glowing like a constellation of death. The first line dove, firing plasma lances that scorched walls and set wood alight. Screams echoed as rubble rained down. Survivors scattered, traps springing alive.</p>

<p>Nora leapt down from her perch, landing hard. Smoke burned her lungs. The bond pulsed—fear, rage, pain, determination—all feeding into her.</p>

<p>A drone swooped for her head. She ducked, yanked her spear free, and jammed it upward into its core. Sparks spitting across her face, the machine crashed lifeless.</p>

<p>The survivors fought with everything. Nets pulled drones down. Torches blinded sensors. Spikes tore wings apart. The air became a storm of fire, steel, and screams.</p>

<p>Still, the drones came.</p>

<p>A boy was snatched, his scream cut short as a clawed talon carried him skyward. The bond wrenched like a knife — his terror flooding them before snapping into silence. Rage roared through the survivors.</p>

<p>“Hold the line!” Nora cried, raw-throated. “Together!”</p>

<p>Something answered. The bond surged. Hands she did not touch, strength she did not possess. Blades flew truer, shields braced harder. The survivors moved as one body, one will, forcing the drones into tight alleys where numbers meant nothing.</p>

<p>By the time the horizon paled, the streets were littered with burning wreckage. Survivors bled, but they stood.</p>

<p>And then the earth trembled.</p>

<p>Not wings. Steps. Heavy. Unstoppable. The army had arrived.</p>

<p>Over the smoking ruins, silhouettes marched — Harvesters by the dozen, weapons glowing in dawn light. Behind them, even larger shapes loomed, bristling with cannons and armor thicker than stone walls.</p>

<p>The night had been only the prelude. Dawn would bring the true war.</p>
