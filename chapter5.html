<h1>Pulse of Connection</h1>
<h2>Chapter Five: Before the Storm</h2>

<p>The night thrummed with tension. Every survivor felt it—the low tremor beneath their feet, the rhythm of countless boots and metal claws striking the earth in unison. The soulless army was moving.</p>

<p>The circle sprang into action. Some scavenged weapons from the ruined Harvesters, hammering blades and shields from broken armor. Others filled sacks with the remaining food. A few searched debris for wires, glass, tubing—anything that could be turned into traps or signals.</p>

<p>Nora moved among them, her broken spear strapped to her back. People looked to her not with doubt, but expectation. Her chest ached. She was no leader, no warrior—just a woman who had survived. Yet their hope steadied her.</p>

<p>“Before dawn,” she called, her voice carrying across the ruins. “We have hours, not days. Use them.”</p>

<p>A murmur of agreement rippled through the group.</p>

<p>She divided them: fighters, builders, scouts, healers. The bond whispered guidance in her mind. The boy she had saved was handed to the healers; he gave her a weak grin. She squeezed his hand and moved on.</p>

<p>Two scouts returned breathless, terror etched in their faces. “They’re not marching blind,” one gasped. “Drones. Hundreds. Searching ahead.”</p>

<p>Nora’s stomach twisted. Drones meant speed—they could find them before dawn.</p>

<p>The voice inside her mind returned, calm despite the chaos. <em>You cannot outfight their numbers, Nora. But you can outthink them. Build. Prepare. And when they strike, let the bond carry you all.</em></p>

<p>She inhaled sharply. “Lay traps in the streets. Nets, spikes, anything to slow them. Fires to blind their sensors. We fight not with strength, but with unity. Every move is one.”</p>

<p>The survivors nodded, fear mingled with resolve.</p>

<p>Through the night they labored. Fires burned in measured lines, walls of smoke built to obscure vision. Spikes were hidden beneath rubble, ropes stretched across alleys. Children and elders were tucked in underground hollows, guarded by the wounded.</p>

<p>Nora climbed the tallest ruin she could find, scanning the horizon. The sound was louder now. Endless. Red eyes glimmered across the darkness.</p>

<p>She gripped the edge of the shattered wall, heart pounding with the rhythm of the circle below. Dawn would bring blood—but also fire. The enemy would not take them easily.</p>

<p>The first drone arrived before the sun touched the horizon. Its wings sliced through the night with a high-pitched whine, red sensors sweeping. Survivors froze.</p>

<p>Nora whispered, “Now.”</p>

<p>A weighted net snapped taut, catching the drone. Sparks flew as it crashed. Cheers rang out—but too soon.</p>

<p>More followed. Dozens. Hundreds. They swarmed, red eyes bright as a constellation of death. The first line dove, plasma lances scorching walls and igniting fires. Screams echoed as debris fell. Survivors scattered, traps springing alive.</p>

<p>Nora leapt from her perch, lungs burning. The bond pulsed—fear, rage, pain, determination—all flowing through her.</p>

<p>A drone swooped. She ducked, drove her spear into its core. Sparks flew, and it crashed lifeless.</p>

<p>Survivors fought with everything: nets, torches, spikes. The air was a storm of fire, steel, and screams.</p>

<p>Then horror. A boy was snatched, his scream cut short. Nora felt the bond wrench, his terror flooding them all before snapping into silence. Rage surged through the survivors.</p>

<p>“Hold the line!” she shouted. “Together!”</p>

<p>The bond responded. Hands she did not touch, strength she did not wield. Blades flew truer, shields braced harder. Survivors moved as one, forcing drones into tight alleys where numbers mattered nothing.</p>

<p>By horizon’s first light, streets were littered with burning wreckage. Survivors bled—but stood.</p>

<p>Then the ground trembled. Heavy.
