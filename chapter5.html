<h1>Pulse of Connection</h1>
<h2>Chapter Five: Before the Storm</h2>

<p>The night was alive with tension. Every survivor felt it — the low tremor beneath their feet, the rhythm of countless boots and metal claws striking earth in unison. The soulless army was moving.</p>

<p>The circle broke into motion. Some gathered weapons from the ruined Harvesters, hacking at armored plates with scavenged tools. Others filled sacks with what little food remained. A few searched the ruins for wires, glass, or tubing — anything that could be turned into traps or signals.</p>

<p>Nora walked among them, her broken spear strapped to her back. People turned to her now, not with doubt, but expectation. It made her chest ache. She was not a leader, not a warrior — just a survivor. Yet when they looked at her, their fear steadied. She forced herself to stand tall.</p>

<p>“Before dawn,” she said, her voice carrying. “That means we have hours — not days. We use them.”</p>

<p>A murmur of agreement rippled through the group.</p>

<p>She divided them quickly: fighters, builders, scouts, healers. The bond whispered instructions in her ear, guiding her choices. The boy she had saved was moved into the healer’s care, and though pale, he managed a weak grin as Nora passed. She squeezed his hand.</p>

<p>At the edge of the ruin, two scouts returned, breathless, terror etched in their faces.</p>

<p>“They’re not marching blind,” one gasped. “Drones. Hundreds of them. Flying ahead of the army. Searching.”</p>

<p>Nora’s stomach tightened. Drones meant speed. They wouldn’t need to wait for dawn to be found.</p>

<p>The voice within her mind returned, calm despite the storm. <em>You cannot outfight their numbers, Nora. But you can outthink them. Build. Prepare. And when they strike, let the bond carry you all.</em></p>

<p>She inhaled sharply. “We lay traps in the streets. Nets, spikes, anything to slow them. Fires to blind their sensors. We fight not with strength, but with unity. Every move we make is as one.”</p>

<p>The survivors nodded. Fear still weighed heavily on their faces, but something new was there too: resolve.</p>

<p>Through the night, they worked. Fires were lit in careful lines, walls of smoke built to obscure vision. Spikes hammered into the ground, ropes stretched across alleys, debris piled high to funnel enemies into choke points. Children and elders were hidden in underground hollows, guarded by the wounded who could no longer fight.</p>

<p>Nora climbed the tallest ruin she could find, watching the horizon. The sound was louder now. Endless. The glow of red eyes spread like embers across the dark.</p>

<p>She gripped the edge of the shattered wall, heart pounding with the rhythm of the circle below. Dawn would bring blood. But it would also bring fire. And she swore the enemy would not take them easily.</p>

<p>The first drone came before the horizon lightened. Its wings cut through the night with a high-pitched whine, red sensors flickering across the ruins. The survivors froze.</p>

<p>Then Nora whispered, “Now.”</p>

<p>A rope snapped taut, pulling a weighted net of chain and debris across the alley. The drone struck, its wings tangled in steel and stone. It shrieked in mechanical fury before being dragged down by waiting hands. Sparks lit the dark like fireflies.</p>

<p>Cheers rang out. Too soon. The sky filled with the sound of more — dozens. Hundreds. They swarmed, red eyes glowing like a constellation of death. Plasma lances scorched walls, set wood alight. Screams echoed as rubble rained down. The survivors scattered into cover, traps springing alive.</p>

<p>Nora leapt down from her perch, landing hard on the broken street. Her lungs burned with smoke. Around her, the bond pulsed — fear, rage, pain, determination — all feeding into her.</p>

<p>A drone swooped for her head. She ducked, yanked her broken spear free, and jammed it upward into its core. Sparks spitted across her face before it crashed lifeless to the ground.</p>

<p>The survivors fought back with everything they had. Nets pulled drones down. Torches hurled to blind sensors. Spikes tore wings apart. The air became a storm of fire, steel, and screams. Still, the drones came.</p>

<p>A boy was snatched, his scream cut short as a clawed talon carried him skyward. Nora felt the bond wrench like a knife in her chest — his terror flooding them all before the connection snapped, leaving only silence. Rage roared through the survivors.</p>

<p>“Hold the line!” Nora cried. Her throat was raw, but her voice cut through the chaos. “Together!”</p>

<p>The bond surged. Hands she did not touch, strength she did not possess. Blades flew truer, shields braced harder. The survivors moved as one body, one will, forcing the drones into tight alleys where numbers meant nothing.</p>

<p>By the time the horizon began to pale, the streets were littered with burning wreckage. Survivors bled, but they stood. And then the earth trembled.</p>

<p>Not from wings. From steps. Heavy. Unstoppable. The army had arrived.</p>

<p>Over the smoking ruins, silhouettes marched — Harvesters by the dozen, weapons glowing in the dawn light. Behind them, even larger shapes loomed, machines Nora had never seen before, bristling with cannons and armor thicker than stone walls.</p>

<p>Dawn had brought the true war.</p>
