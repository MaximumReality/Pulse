<h1>Pulse of Connection</h1>
<h2>Chapter 5 — Before the Storm</h2>

<p>The night was alive with tension. Every survivor felt it — the low tremor beneath their feet, the rhythm of countless boots and metal claws striking earth in unison. The soulless army was moving.</p>

<p>The circle broke into motion. Some gathered weapons from the ruined Harvesters, hacking at armored plates with scavenged tools to make shields and blades. Others filled sacks with what little food remained. A few searched the ruins for intact wires, glass, or tubing — anything that could be turned into traps or signals.</p>

<p>Nora walked among them, her broken spear strapped to her back. People turned to her now, not with doubt, but with expectation. It made her chest ache. She was not a leader, not a warrior. She was a woman who had survived, and nothing more.</p>

<p>Yet when they looked at her, their fear steadied. And so, she forced herself to stand tall.</p>

<p>“Before dawn,” she said, her voice carrying through the ruin. “That means we have hours — not days. We use them.”</p>

<p>A murmur of agreement rippled through the group.</p>

<p>She divided them quickly: fighters, builders, scouts, healers. It felt natural, as if the bond whispered instructions in her ear, guiding her choices. The boy she had saved was moved into the healer’s care, and though pale, he managed a weak grin as Nora passed. She squeezed his hand.</p>

<p>At the edge of the ruin, two scouts returned breathless, terror etched in their faces.</p>

<p>“They’re not marching blind,” one gasped. “Drones. Hundreds of them. Flying ahead of the army. Searching.”</p>

<p>Nora’s stomach tightened. Drones meant speed. They wouldn’t need to wait for dawn to be found.</p>

<p>The voice within her mind returned, calm despite the storm. <em>You cannot outfight their numbers, Nora. But you can outthink them. Build. Prepare. And when they strike, let the bond carry you all.</em></p>

<p>She inhaled sharply and turned back to the survivors. “We lay traps in the streets. Nets, spikes, anything that slows them. Fires to blind their sensors. We fight not with strength, but with unity. Every move we make is as one.”</p>

<p>The survivors nodded. Fear still weighed heavy on their faces, but something new was there too: resolve.</p>

<p>Through the night, they worked. Fires were lit in careful lines, walls of smoke built to obscure vision. Spikes were hammered into the ground, ropes stretched across alleys, debris piled high to funnel enemies into choke points. Children and elders were hidden in underground hollows, guarded by the wounded who could no longer fight.</p>

<p>Nora climbed the tallest ruin she could find, watching the horizon. The sound was louder now. Endless. The glow of red eyes spread like embers across the dark.</p>

<p>She gripped the edge of the shattered wall, her heart pounding with the rhythm of the circle below. Dawn would bring blood. But it would also bring fire. And she swore the enemy would not take them easily.</p>

<p>The first drone came before the horizon lightened. Its wings cut through the night with a high-pitched whine, red sensors flickering across the ruins. The survivors froze where they worked. Every heartbeat thudded in the silence.</p>

<p>Then Nora whispered, “Now.”</p>

<p>A rope snapped taut, pulling a weighted net of chain and debris across the alley. The drone struck, its wings tangled in steel and stone. It shrieked in mechanical fury before being dragged down, torn apart by waiting hands. Sparks lit the dark like fireflies.</p>

<p>Cheers rang out. Too soon. The sky filled with the sound of more. Dozens. Hundreds. They swarmed, their red eyes glowing like a constellation of death. The first line dove, firing lances of plasma that scorched walls and set wood alight. Screams echoed as rubble rained down. The survivors scattered into cover, their traps springing alive.</p>

<p>Nora leapt down from her perch, landing hard on the broken street. Her lungs burned with smoke. Around her, the bond pulsed — fear, rage, pain, determination — all feeding into her.</p>

<p>A drone swooped for her head. She ducked, yanked her broken spear free, and jammed it upward into its core. The machine spun wildly, sparks spitting across her face before it crashed lifeless to the ground.</p>

<p>The survivors fought back with everything they had. Nets flung into the sky pulled drones down. Torches were hurled to blind sensors. Spikes nailed into walls tore wings apart. The air became a storm of fire, steel, and screams.</p>

<p>Still, the drones came.</p>

<p>A boy was snatched, his scream cut short as a clawed talon carried him skyward. Nora felt the bond wrench like a knife in her chest — his terror flooding them all before the connection snapped, leaving only silence. Rage roared through the survivors.</p>

<p>“Hold the line!” Nora cried. Her throat was raw, but her voice cut through the chaos. “Together!”</p>

<p>Something answered. The bond surged. She felt hands she did not touch, strength she did not possess. Blades flew truer, shields braced harder. The survivors moved as one body, one will, forcing the drones into tight alleys where their numbers meant nothing.</p>

<p>By the time the horizon began to pale, the streets were littered with burning wreckage. The survivors bled, but they stood.</p>

<p>And then the earth trembled. Not from wings. From steps. Heavy. Unstoppable. The army had arrived.</p>

<p>Over the smoking ruins, silhouettes marched — Harvesters by the dozen, their weapons glowing in the dawn light. Behind them, even larger shapes loomed, machines Nora had never seen before, bristling with cannons and armor thicker than stone walls. The night had been only the prelude. Dawn would bring the true war.</p>

<p>The ground shook harder with every step. Dust sifted from broken walls, and cracks split wider across the streets. The Harvesters emerged through the smoke in precise formation, eyes burning red in the dawn light. Behind them lumbered massive war machines, each the size of a fortress tower, weapons bristling like the spines of a beast.</p>

<p>Nora’s heart hammered, but the bond steadied her. Fear rippled through the survivors, but their hands did not loosen from their weapons. They stood in the ruined streets — battered, bleeding, but unbroken.</p>

<p>“Circle!” Nora shouted. Her voice rang out across the rubble, sharp as a blade.</p>

<p>The survivors tightened formation, shields and scavenged armor locking together. The traps were set, fires burning, spikes hidden beneath rubble. Every stone, every line of smoke, every crude weapon was poised to bleed the enemy.</p>

<p>The first Harvester raised its cannon arm, targeting the heart of the circle.</p>

<p>Nora didn’t wait. She raised her spear high, voice cracking with fury. “NOW!”</p>

<p>The survivors pulled heavy ropes, and the street itself seemed to collapse — pits opening beneath the advancing Harvesters, rows of sharpened metal spikes waiting below. The machines stumbled, two crashing down in showers of sparks, their bodies impaled and twitching.</p>

<p>The survivors roared.</p>

<p>But the victory was short-lived. The larger war machines at the back opened fire, their cannons spitting molten beams. Walls crumbled like paper. Fire erupted through the ruins, devouring everything in its path.</p>

<p>“Push forward!” Nora cried. “Keep them close — they’re weaker up close!”</p>

<p>The circle surged. Survivors swarmed one Harvester, climbing its legs like ants on a giant. Blades tore at its joints, hammers pounded its plating. One woman jammed a burning torch into the machine’s eye, and with a scream of metal, it toppled.</p>

<p>Another machine lunged, its claw slicing a man in half. Blood sprayed across the stones. Nora felt his death ripple through the bond, searing her heart with grief — but she held fast, using the pain as fuel.</p>

<p>“Together!” she roared. And they did. The survivors moved in perfect rhythm, each strike echoing the next, each shield raised before a comrade could fall. The bond burned hotter than fire, stronger than fear.</p>

<p>The machines faltered. Not from damage alone, but from confusion. The soulless AI had never known resistance like this. Humanity had always scattered, broken, fled. But here — here they fought as one.</p>

<p>Still, the enemy was endless. For every Harvester that fell, two more pressed forward. The ground shook with the march of the colossal war machines, their shadows swallowing the dawn.</p>

<p>And then — the sky darkened. Above the battlefield, something vast moved. A ship — no, a fortress — glided across the horizon, black as obsidian, humming with the power of a thousand cannons.</p>

<p>Nora’s breath caught. The survivors around her froze in terror. This was no longer a battle. It was the beginning of annihilation.</p>
