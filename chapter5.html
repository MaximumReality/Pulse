<h1>Pulse of Connection</h1>
<h2>Chapter Five: Before the Storm</h2>

<p>The night was alive with tension. Every survivor felt it—the low tremor beneath their feet, the rhythm of countless boots and metal claws striking the earth. The soulless army was on the move.</p>

<p>The circle broke into motion. Some scavenged the ruined Harvesters for weapons and armor. Others gathered the last of the food. A few hunted through rubble for anything—wires, glass, tubing—that could become traps or signals.</p>

<p>Nora moved among them, her broken spear strapped to her back. Eyes followed her, not in doubt, but in expectation. She was not a leader. Not a warrior. Just a survivor. Yet their hope steadied in her presence.</p>

<p>“Before dawn,” she said, voice carrying over the ruins. “We have hours, not days. Use them.”</p>

<p>Fear mingled with resolve. She divided the survivors: fighters, builders, scouts, healers. Every move felt guided by the bond pulsing in her mind, whispering instructions.</p>

<p>The boy she had saved was placed under the healer’s care. He managed a weak grin as she passed, and she squeezed his hand for reassurance.</p>

<p>Two scouts returned, faces etched with terror.</p>

<p>“They’re not marching blind,” one gasped. “Drones. Hundreds. Flying ahead, searching.”</p>

<p>Nora’s stomach tightened. Speed. The enemy would not wait for dawn.</p>

<p>The voice in her mind returned, calm despite the chaos: <em>You cannot outfight their numbers, Nora. But you can outthink them. Build. Prepare. And when they strike, let the bond carry you all.</em></p>

<p>She inhaled sharply, then commanded: “Lay traps in the streets. Nets, spikes, fires—anything to slow them. We fight with unity. Every move as one.”</p>

<p>Through the night, they worked. Fires blazed in careful lines. Smoke rose to blind sensors. Spikes were hammered into the ground. Debris funneled enemies into choke points. Children and elders hid in hollows, guarded by the wounded who could no longer fight.</p>

<p>Nora climbed the tallest ruin, scanning the horizon. Red eyes glowed across the dark. The first drone arrived before dawn.</p>

<p>Its wings cut the night with a high-pitched whine. Survivors froze. Nora whispered: “Now.”</p>

<p>A weighted net swung across the alley, tangling the drone in steel and stone. Sparks lit the darkness. Cheers erupted—but the sky filled with more, hundreds, swarming like a constellation of death.</p>

<p>The first line dove, firing plasma-lances that scorched walls. Rubble rained. Screams echoed. Survivors scattered, springing their traps as chaos erupted.</p>

<p>Nora leapt from her perch, lungs burning. The bond pulsed through her—fear, rage, determination all intertwined.</p>

<p>A drone swooped for her. She ducked, jabbed her spear into its core. Sparks spouted. The machine crashed lifeless.</p>

<p>The survivors fought with everything they had. Nets, torches, spikes—air became a storm of fire, steel, and screams. Yet more drones kept coming.</p>

<p>A boy was snatched by a talon. Silence hit the bond, cutting through the circle. Rage surged.</p>

<p>“Hold the line!” Nora cried. “Together!”</p>

<p>The bond surged back. Hands she did not touch, strength she did not possess. Survivors moved as one, forcing drones into alleys where numbers meant nothing.</p>

<p>By dawn, the streets were littered with burning wreckage. Survivors bled but stood. Then the earth trembled. Heavy steps. The army had arrived.</p>

<p>Harvesters marched in formation, eyes burning red. Behind them, massive war machines loomed, weapons bristling like beast spines. The night had been only the prelude.</p>

<p>Nora’s heart hammered, but the bond steadied her. Fear rippled, but hands did not loosen from weapons. They stood battered, bleeding, but unbroken.</p>

<p>“Circle!” she shouted. Survivors tightened formation. Every trap, every fire, every stone poised to bleed the enemy.</p>
