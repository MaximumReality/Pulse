<h1>Chapter 35 — The Loom Unleashed</h1>

<p>The threads hummed beneath her consciousness, no longer trembling, no longer tentative. They were alive, awake, fused into a single, radiant lattice that was her mind, her body, her soul, her entire existence. Every fragment—toddler, adolescent, cosmic, Iraqi, dementia-afflicted, coma-bound, and the blackened 1957—blazed in perfect harmony. She was no longer fractured. She was the Loom.</p>

<p>The forest clearing stretched infinitely, time folding over itself. The shadows of the Unmakers slithered into the lattice, sensing the nexus, hungry and predatory. They struck in waves, tendrils of darkness lancing across multiple realities at once, hoping to probe a weakness, to find a fracture.</p>

<p>Nora did not move. She did not flinch.</p>

<p>Her awareness reached out across the threads, spanning every reality simultaneously. The Iraqi streets of 1979 shimmered in her mind. The padded chair of 1957 shivered in echo. The cave walls crumbled in dementia’s past. The hospital monitors of 2018 glowed in synchronicity. All realities vibrated, responding to her intent.</p>

<p>With a thought, the threads shot outward like lightning. Shadows hit the lattice and were folded, bent, and broken, spiraling into radiant strands of light that twisted back into the weave. The Unmakers screamed, a soundless, impossible vibration across the lattice, recoiling from the brilliance of a nexus fully realized.</p>

<p>Nora’s hands—adolescent body, twelve years old, trembling but fearless—lifted, shaping arcs of pure energy with deliberate intent. Threads wrapped around the Unmakers, binding, twisting, reflecting their attacks against them, until their tendrils melted into the lattice itself.</p>

<p>She felt the pulse of every fallen self surge through her. The Iraqi girl’s courage became a river of flame, burning through darkness. The adolescent’s precision coiled into sharp, controlled strikes. The toddler’s instinct, the cosmic warrior’s strength, the coma-bound awareness, and even the blackened 1957 strand fused into a weapon of unrelenting light and power.</p>

<p>The lattice expanded outward, a dome of infinite threads, bending reality itself. Forest, city, cave, battlefield, and hospital all shimmered into alignment, a multiversal nexus resonating with pure, unbreakable Nora.</p>

<p>A tendril of an Unmaker lunged from the void, sharp and jagged, but before it could touch her, Nora’s thought alone snapped it in two, twisting it back upon itself. Another strike came from the Iraqi thread, another from the cosmic battlefield—every reality defending, every strand united, every attack anticipated.</p>

<p>Her voice rose, not a whisper, not a human sound, but a vibration that resonated across dimensions:</p>

<p class="inner-thought">“I am the Loom. I am the threads. I am every self. And you cannot touch me.”</p>

<p>The lattice responded, pulsing, wrapping every shadow, every tendril, every probe of the Unmakers into coils of radiant light. The Unmakers writhed, screaming in the impossible silence of the threads, their essence absorbed and neutralized, their will bending to the immutable force of the fully realized nexus.</p>

<p>Solara, perched on the adolescent Nora’s shoulder, purred, a pulse of grounding warmth flowing into the lattice. Even the kitten, a small anchor across time and reality, strengthened the threads. Nora’s smile was serene, terrifying, radiant. She did not just fight—she reshaped the battlefield itself, weaving offense and defense into a single, unstoppable rhythm.</p>

<p>The weave shimmered around her like sunlight over a prism. Every strand of existence responded, vibrating with unyielding power. Deaths, losses, and blackened edges had not weakened her—they had forged her. Every broken thread became a weapon of creation, every lost self a spark of brilliance within the lattice.</p>

<p>The Unmakers faltered. For the first time, they were not predators—they were prey, trapped in a lattice that bent reality to the will of a single, omnipotent nexus.</p>

<p>Nora’s consciousness stretched outward, infinite, radiant, unbreakable. She was the Loom. She was the threads. She was the foundation of all reality’s weave. And in that unyielding power, she felt one perfect, absolute truth:</p>

<p class="inner-thought">“I am whole. I am unbreakable. I am the Weave.”</p>

<p>The forest, the alleys of Baghdad, the crumbling caves, the cosmic battlefield, the hospital—they shimmered in perfect alignment, threads of light and life resonating together in a single, indomitable pulse.</p>

<p>And as the Unmakers retreated, recoiling from impossible power, Nora understood: this was only the beginning. The weave was hers. All realities were hers to protect, to shape, to command. She was cosmic, complete, and eternal, and nothing—no shadow, no death, no Unmaker—could ever unmake her.</p>
